# SpotifyPlaylistDownloader
A very simple app which takes a spotify playlist link, gets all the music and artists names and then searches on YouTube Music and downloads them as mp3 files to 'internalstorage/Download/spd'.
This app technically uses YouTube to find the music but searches in a way that results are audio versions (the ones uploaded to YouTube music) and not video music.
This app uses 2 simple apis. Spotify web api and khttp.
I dont want to make this app too complicated and keep it very simple.
Few more features might be added in future.
