# Introduction
SpotifyPlaylistDownloader is a very simple app which takes a spotify playlist link and downloads them as mp3 files to 'internalstorage/Download/spd'.
This app technically uses YouTube to find the music but searches in a way that results are audio versions (the ones uploaded to YouTube music) and not YouTube.
This app uses 2 simple apis. Spotify web api and khttp and Spotify to mp3 website.
Few more features might be added in future.
